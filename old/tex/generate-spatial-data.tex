\title{Generate Auto-correlated Spatial Data}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

We need to simulate data based on the distribution of trees in plots and their relative sizes.
This amounts to generating spatially correlated random fields - aka unconditional gaussian simulation?.  
\section{Notes}
Two possible ways using R libraries.
\begin{itemize}
\item gstat
\item fields


\end{itemize}
