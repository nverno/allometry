\section{Simplest}
The 'simplest' neighborhood model takes the form:

\begin{equation}
  rGR = PG * Competition\,\, {effect}
\end{equation}
Here, if we have a proper envelope, $PG$ should be estimated to be 1.  Thus the equation
becomes:
\begin{equation}
  rGR = exp \left ( -C \sum^N_j \frac{bvs_{j}^\alpha}{distances_{ij}^\beta} \right )
\end{equation}
where N is the number of neighbors for a given target tree $i$, and T is the number of target trees.  Then, $distances_{ij}$ is the distance between target $i$ and neighbor $j$,
and $bv_j$ is the bole volume of neighbor $j$.
